# Solarystem

Our journey to understanding what lies beyond our planet, as a means to better comprehend our universe, is a notable comparison out of the many metaphors describing the human experience. I decided to combine my appreciation for the cosmos with the skillsets I’ve learned throughout the course of this class. The objective behind my final project is to demonstrate mastery of the lessons and to develop a program that hopefully inspires a feeling of wonderment.

Solarystem begins with simply two planets and the sun. The user is to control a spaceship around the solar system and collect stars. Following the feedback of my proposal, I figured out a way to exemplify — although miniature in comparison to the actual efforts — the lengths undergone by the human race, in its array of celestial discoveries. Therefore, the user must collect a precise amount of stars to unlock a new planet. Once appeared, the user may approach it to view its description and occupy its environment.
