let hamlet1 = "To be or not to be";

let hamlet2 = 'That is the question';   //single quote

let hamlet3 = `Hello nation`;          //backtick



//Why we should carefully pick how to indicate your strings

//imagine
let string = "She said, "You can't kill me, i'm a bad b-tch!"";
//you're confused, javascript is confused, thus use another method
